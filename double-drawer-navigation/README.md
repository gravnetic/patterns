# Double Drawer (Off-Canvas) Navigation

Double drawer navigation was used on the Boston Chefs project. It provides markup, js, and css
to display two seperate panels ( 1 on the left and 1 on the right ) that slide in, app style,
from each side when triggered at the mobile breakpoint.

Markup may need to be modified in order to create the expected markup pattern.
